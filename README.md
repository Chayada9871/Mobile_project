For each app, you are to create the mock data necessary for the app to function. For
example, the Hotel booking app would need to have data about rooms and their availability.
In order to hold this data, each app would need to have some kind of backend and a
database. You may use a backend and DB of your choice. Alternatively, you may use
Firebase/Supabase or any other managed backend. The specific requirements for each app
is discussed below.
